# MyBB_Plugin-Audentio_Affiliates

 *  Audentio Design Affiliated Themes Plugin
 *  Authors: Audentio Design & updated by Vintagedaddyo

Allows users to easily have an affiliated themes area on their forums
 
To Install:

Upload the contents within /upload/ to your forum root directory.
Go to Admin CP And Active it and set settings in configuration settings


* note: I had a little bit of free time and had noticed awhile back that 
this no longer worked due to several factors to include the fact of site 
removal of affiliates functionality and site change from audentio to themehouse thus causing the links and images to not 
work and such as well as mant themes needed to be added. This simple edit 
quickly touch on those related update edits and any other minor edits simply 
done in my limited free time to get the item re-functioning. That is all.
